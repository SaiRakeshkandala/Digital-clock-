# Digital Clock and Factorial Calculator  

This project is a combination of a **Digital Clock** and a **Factorial Calculator**, implemented using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It showcases basic web development concepts with real-time functionality and interactive user input processing.

## **Features**  

### **1. Digital Clock**  
- Displays the current time in real-time (`HH:MM:SS` format).  
- Automatically updates every second using JavaScript.  

### **2. Factorial Calculator**  
- Calculates the factorial of a given positive integer using both **iterative** and **recursive** methods.  
- Validates input to ensure only non-negative integers are accepted.  
- Displays results dynamically upon calculation.  

---

## **Technologies Used**  
- **HTML5:** Structure of the web page.  
- **CSS3:** Styling for an attractive and responsive layout.  
- **JavaScript:** Logic for real-time clock updates and factorial calculations.

## **How to Use**  
1. Download or clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/digital-clock-factorial-calculator.git
   ```  

2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.  

3. **Digital Clock:**  
   - The current time will display automatically upon opening the page.  

4. **Factorial Calculator:**  
   - Enter a positive integer in the input box under the "Factorial Calculator" section.  
   - Click the "Calculate" button to see the results using both iterative and recursive methods.

## **Project Structure**  
- **HTML:**  
  Contains the page structure, including the digital clock and factorial calculator sections.  

- **CSS:**  
  Styles the web page for a clean and user-friendly appearance.  

- **JavaScript:**  
  Handles:  
  - Real-time updates for the digital clock.  
  - Input validation for the factorial calculator.  
  - Factorial computation logic (iterative and recursive).  

---

## **Sample Output**  

### Digital Clock  
Displays the current time dynamically:  
```
12:45:30
```

### Factorial Calculator  
For input `5`, the results are displayed as:  
```
Iterative: 120  
Recursive: 120  
```

## **Future Enhancements**  
- Add a date display to the digital clock.  
- Enhance the factorial calculator with larger number support and error messages for invalid inputs.  
- Add light/dark mode toggle for the page.
